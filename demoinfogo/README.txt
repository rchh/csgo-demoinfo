CS:GO Demos and Network Messages
--------------------------------

Demos and network messages in CS:GO use Google's Protocol Buffers (protobuf). Protobuf is a message/object serialization language that generates code to serialize the objects efficiently. For information about protobuf, see https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview

demoinfogo.exe is a tool that parses CS:GO demo files (ending in .dem) and dumps out every message in the demo. Using this tool, third parties can parse the demo for various game events to generate information and statistics.

The zip file DemoinfoGO contains demoinfogo.exe and the source code required to build this tool. The source includes the proto files containing network message definitions.


Building demoinfogo
------------------

In order to build demoinfogo on Windows, follow these steps

1. Download and extract demoinfogo.zip (XXX). This creates a folder called demoinfogo.
2. Download protobuf-2.5.0.zip (http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/downloads/detail?name=protobuf-2.5.0.zip&can=2&q=) and extract it into the demoinfogo folder. This creates the folder demoinfogp/protobuf-2.5.0.
3. Download the protocol buffer compiler protoc-2.5.0.zip (http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/downloads/detail?name=protoc-2.5.0-win32.zip&can=2&q=) and extract it into the demoinfogo/protoc-2.5.0-win32 folder that was created when you extracted demoinfogo.zip.
4. Open demoinfogo/protobuf-2.5.0/vsprojects/protobuf.sln in Microsoft Visual Studio 2010. Allow Visual Studio to convert projects. Once loaded, build the Release configuration of libprotobuf. Building any other projects is not required.
5. Open the project demoinfogo/demoinfogo.vcxproj in Microsoft Visual Studio 2010. Building the Release configuration creates the binary demoinfogo/demoinfogo.exe


Working with Network Messages
-----------------------------

Building demoinfogo generates C++ classes from the network protobuf files. Follow these steps to generate these files for use in your application without building demoinfogo
1. Follow the instructions above for extracting protobuf 2.5.0 and protoc 2.5.0
2. Run make_cc_files.bat. The generated C++ files are created in subdirectory named generated_proto.


You can now use the generated classes in your C++ code to send user messages. Here is an example of how to send the HintText message

CSingleUserRecipientFilter filter( this );
filter.MakeReliable();
CCSUsrMsg_HintText msg;
msg.set_text( "ExampleHint" );
SendUserMessage( filter, CS_UM_HintText, msg );
